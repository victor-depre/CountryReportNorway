# Why did I choose Norway ?

I chose Norway because it is a very interesting country that is quite exemplary and could inspire many other countries in economic, social and especially environmental terms.

---------------

## Introduction

--------------------

Historically, Norway has long been one of the poorest countries in Europe, but the very interesting development of this country has made it today a rich country with a very high standard of living and well-being. With an HDI of 0.954 in 2018, Norway defies all competition and is in pole position worldwide. 

Add to this the ecological awareness of its citizens, which has made Norway one of the precursors of the ecological transition and we have a country that is more than exemplary, both economically and socially as well as environmentally.
